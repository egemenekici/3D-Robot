# 3D - Robot

It's a 3D robot model viewer application that is written by using WebGL. In this program, by using GUI elements and through keyboard and mouse, user should be able to change the surface color and transparency for the robot, reposition, rotate, or scale the model, change between orthogonal and perspective projections and view the model as a wireframe.
